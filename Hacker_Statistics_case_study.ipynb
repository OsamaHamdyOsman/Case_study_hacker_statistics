    "# Case Study: Hacker Statistics\n",

    "## Context\n",
    "> * Imagine this situation. You are walking up the empire state building and you're playing a game with a friend. For 100 times you throw a dice, if it's 1 or 2 you go one step down. If it's 3, 4 or 5 you go one step up. Finally, if you throw a 6 you throw the dice again and will walk the resulting number of eyes up. \n",
    "> * You go lower than step zero.\n",
    "> * You admit that you are a bit clumsy and have a chnace of 0.1 % of falling down the stairs when you make a move. Falling down means that you have to start again from step 0. \n",

    "With all of that in mind you bet with your friend that's you will reach 60 steps high.\n",

You would have a succession of random steps or in other words **_a random walk_**. This is a well known concept in science. For example, the path traced by a molecule as it travels through a liquid or gas can be **modeled** as a random walk. Financial status of a gambler is another example.\n",
